# Whale-identification-from-tail-images

The objective of the exercise is to identify whale labels from their tail images. This is a kaggle project and was taken up by myself to make my understanding on image classification concepts more robust. 

The entire code is written in pytorch and the models experimented were Resnet18,34 and 50. Multiple optimization techniques were also experimented. The context about the project is given in the below link. The project was done in colab
